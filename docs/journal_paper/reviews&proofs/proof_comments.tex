\begin{enumerate}
\item I have broken equations into multiple lines as desired in this pdf.  Please follow my preferences, where possible.
\item $\Delta$ should not be italicized  in text (it is in \emph{some} examples in the bottom right of page 2
\item Lists in text should use lower case roman numerals, eg, (i), (ii), etc.  See first paragraph of Mathematical Methods for an example.
\item In eq 9, the number should be on the same line as the equation
\item In Eq 10, the two equals signs should be aligned. Also, can they be independently labeled (as I have done)?
\item The word ``neuropil'' is a word, please do not change it to ``neutrophil''.
\item In the appendix, please confirm that subscripts and superscripts are correct, as indicated by my pdf.
\item Please use the indicated font for the set of all integers (it is a standard font).
\item Please do not replace my ``G'' with a ``Q'' (see, for example Eq 50).
\item Please use a script ``F'' where I have (see the section entitled ``Spike rate parameters'').
\item Please use the appropriate font for the word ``quadprog''
\item Please do not include links in the references section
