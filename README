This is a repository containing the code to implement the algorithms employed in Vogelstein et al, 2009 (in press).  The repository is organized as follows.  There are three main folders, code, data,  and docs.  

1) code contains all the scripts one needs to run our algorithm (as well as our license agreement).
2) data contains the data used to make each of the figures in from the paper.
3) docs contains all the files used to make the paper, including code for running the simulations in the paper.

Please respect our policy of openness, and operate accordingly.
