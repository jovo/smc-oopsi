This is a repository containing the code to implement the algorithms employed in Vogelstein et al, 2009 (in press).  The repository is organized as follows:

-- text: contains tex and compiled other files of submitted manuscript (and some minor revisions) 
-- functions: contains functions required to use our smc algorithm to infer spikes (and a subfolder called for_figs containing older versions used in creating some of the figures)
-- scripts: each script calls various functions, saves the data (simulated or analyzed), and generates figures
-- data: raw and simulated data used to make figures
-- figs: pdf files for each final figure
-- general_background: a document containing some general background information that might be useful
-- reviews&proofs: reviews and proofs from BJ to get this paper published

Please respect our policy of openness, and operate accordingly.
