This is a repository containing the code to implement the algorithms employed in Vogelstein et al, 2009 (in press).  The repository is organized as follows:

Repository Organization
=======================

* text: contains tex and compiled other files of submitted manuscript (and some minor revisions) 
* functions: contains functions required to use our smc algorithm to infer spikes (and a subfolder called for_figs containing older versions used in creating some of the figures)
* scripts: each script calls various functions, saves the data (simulated or analyzed), and generates figures
* data: raw and simulated data used to make figures
* figs: pdf files for each final figure
* general_background: a document containing some general background information that might be useful
* reviews&proofs: reviews and proofs from BJ to get this paper published

Quick Tips
==========

* final version of proof may be found [here] [1] 
* to learn how to use the algorithm, i suggest playing with scripts in the script folder
* any questions or issues, please use the [issues tab] [2]
* any problems with that, or questions inappropriate for that forum, please contact me at: joshuav@jhu.edu
* please respect our policy of openness, and operate accordingly.
